# Tests for the @euriklis/validator package

This code contains tests for the library @euriklis/validator - a type driven oriented package for manipulation variables in javascript. The tests are not completed and contain the main methods of the library, i.e., the for_all, interface2, is_integer and is_same_with_any methods. But it is needed to be notices, that a set of other additional methods are also tested implicitly like the and, not , or operators and the bind method.
